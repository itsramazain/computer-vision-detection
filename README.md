# 🎯 Four Across Game

[![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/itsramazain/four_accross_game?style=social)](https://github.com/itsramazain/four_accross_game)

**Four Across** is a browser-based implementation of *Connect Four* — a two-player strategy game where players alternate dropping pieces into a grid and aim to connect four in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally). ([GitHub][1])

---

## 🚀 Features

✔ Two-player local gameplay
✔ Classic win condition logic
✔ Runs directly in the browser (no setup required)
✔ Clean and mobile-friendly UI

---

## 📌 Game Rules (Quick)

1. Players take turns dropping their colored discs into one of the columns.
2. The disc occupies the lowest available space in that column.
3. First player to connect four of their discs in a line wins.
4. If the board fills up with no winner, the game ends in a draw. ([GitHub][1])

# 🧠 Computer Vision Detection

[![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/itsramazain/computer-vision-detection?style=social)](https://github.com/itsramazain/computer-vision-detection)

A Computer Vision project for detecting objects, faces, or features using Python and OpenCV (or other frameworks). *(Update this description once you’ve added project details.)* ([GitHub][2])

---

## 🔍 Overview

This repository contains code for real-time object detection using video or camera input. It may use popular libraries like:

* **OpenCV**
* **TensorFlow / PyTorch**
* **YOLO or Haar Cascades**

Feel free to customize based on your actual implementation! ([GitHub][2])

---

## 🚀 Features

✔ Real-time detection from webcam/video
✔ Bounding boxes + labels for detected objects
✔ Works with common model files (e.g., `.pb`, `.weights`, `.cfg`)
✔ Easy to extend with new classes

---

## 🧩 Prerequisites

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Example packages:

```
opencv-python
numpy
tensorflow
```

---

## 🛠️ Setup & Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/itsramazain/computer-vision-detection.git
   ```
2. Enter the folder:

   ```bash
   cd computer-vision-detection
   ```
3. Run detection script:

   ```bash
   python detect.py
   ```

*(Change `detect.py` to whatever the actual main script is.)* ([GitHub][2])

---

## 🤖 Models

Explain the models you’re using (if any):

* **Haar Cascade for face detection**
* **YOLOv8 for object detection**
* **Custom trained models**

*(Adjust this list to match your actual content.)* ([GitHub][2])

---

## 🚀 Next Improvements

You could add:

✔ Support for multiple model choices
✔ Webcam/Video switch flag
✔ Config file for thresholds
✔ Logging and result saving
